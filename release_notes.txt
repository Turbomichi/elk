elk-1.2.15
-SS and JKD added the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for linear optics
 calculations. This feature works with LDA+U, magnetism and spin-orbit coupling.
 It is also parallelised with MPI and can be run across a cluster. See the
 'LiF-BSE' and 'Si-BSE' examples. Currently an experimental feature
-Alexey Baranov added density and magnetic structure factors: see the
 'MnO-str-factors' example
-AB also fixed a problem with output of the spacegroup code
-full frequency and G vector dependent RPA inverse dielectric function now
 available with 'task=180'. Works with metals, insulators, magnetism and SOC,
 and can be calculated for arbitrary complex frequencies. Also parallelised with
 OpenMP and MPI. Thanks to Anton Kozhevnikov for discussions
-added lots more MPI parallelism and made the code more MPI-friendly
-many optimisations across the whole code
-Simone Chiesa, Anton Kozhevnikov and Adolfo Eguiluz found a problem in the
 plotting of the partial DOS which has now been fixed
-the first-variational eigenvalue matrices can now be stored and diagonalised in
 non-packed storage mode: use 'tpmat=.false.'. This can speed up calculations at the expense of memory
-Tyrel McQueen found a bug in the 'findprim' routine, now fixed
-TMcQ also suggested a change to how the code connects the points of the
 'plot1d' vertices
-Martin Stankovski suggested that 'ecvcut' be made into an input variable,
 allowing the core-valence cut-off to be adjusted
-added the phonon calculation of Ni to the examples
-Jerzy Goraus contributed a script for calculating VB-XPS spectra from PDOS*
 files; and also one for converting the Wien2K struct file to spacegroup.in
-modified some species files thanks to tests done by J. Goraus
-Henning Glawe suggested including the version number in the release directory
-upgraded to LAPACK 3.3.0
-made tolerance for finding the linearisation energies (epsband) much smaller:
 this improves the overall stability of the self-consistent loop
Notes for developers
-arguments to 'genppts' have changed; also the non-reduced k-points are now
 stored in the remaining part of the reduced k-point arrays

elk-1.1.4
-message passing interface (MPI) parallel runs now available; scalable to
 hundreds of cores across a cluster; can also be used as hybrid OpenMP+MPI
 parallelism for maximum efficiency; with thanks to Bhagawan Sahu for help
 with testing; see manual for compilation and running instructions
-S. Sharma added susceptibility tensor for non-linear optical second-harmonic
 generation (SHG); see example 'GaAs-NLO' for details
-added spin-orbit correction to momentum matrix elements; affects linear and
 non-linear optics
-optical calculations now work in combination with spin-spirals
-updated interface to version 1.0 of the ETSF exchange-correlation library,
 libxc; thanks to M. Marques and T. McQueen for assistance
-fixed bug spotted by T. McQueen involving using multiple tasks in conjunction
 with 'primcell=.true.'
-A. Kozhevnikov fixed bug in 'xc_pwca.f90'
-A. Kozhevnikov also fixed serious bug in 'getevecfv.f90'
-F. Cricchio changed the order of lattice vector angles in 'spacegroup' utility
 to 'bc, ac, ab' which corresponds to the convention alpha, beta, gamma
-removed scissor correction from eigenvalue solver; now it is used, as before,
 only in optics calculations
-T. McQueen suggested an improvement to the routine which generates the path in
 reciprocal space for bandstructure plots, 'connect.f90', which has been
 implemented
-fixed problem with XCrysDen Fermi surface plots, spotted by FC
-various optimisations and simplifications
Notes for developers
-arguments to 'zpotcoul' have changed in anticipation of linear-response
 phonons; should now be called in conjunction with 'genzvclmt'

elk-1.0.17
-fixed problem with Fermi surface generation introduced in the last version
-E. K. U. Gross added to list of main developers
-no other changes

elk-1.0.16
-fixed problem in linear optics calculations for metals - thanks to Antonio
 Sanna, Fabio Bernardini and Sandro Massida for pointing this out
-FC and LN added option for automatic determination of APW linearisation
 energies (use 'autolinengy=.true.')
-Marty Blaber made a script which allows for semi-automatic labeling of the
 vertex locations with gnuplot (found in the 'elk/utilities' directory)
-FC and LN fixed problem with some compilers when writing FERMISURF.OUT
-FC and LN fixed problem with writing XCrysDen Fermi surface plots
-Anton Kozhevnikov found and fixed a problem with the generation of the
 irreducible representation file 'ELMIREP.OUT'
-Torbjörn Björkman added a new routine which automatically determines the
 smearing width from the k-point density. See 'autoswidth' in the manual and
 the example 'Nb-autoswidth' for details
-added a constant electric field E in the form of a saw-tooth potential: set the
 vector 'efieldc' (experimental)
-added a constant vector potential A to the Hamiltonian to generate constant
 currents: set the variable 'afieldc' (experimental)
-FC and LN fixed problem with a spin-polarised GGA routine
-FC and LN pointed out that the energy term associated with the excess charge
 compensating background should be zero. This term has now been removed
-code now more memory efficient thanks to smarter array allocation
-the variable 'rgkmax' can now be made arbitrarily large without risk of
 instability
-removed variable 'cfdamp'
-Anton Kozhevnikov pointed out that the radial functions were being redundantly
 calculated for equivalent atoms -- now fixed
-Anton Filanovich added several questions to the FAQ
-scissors correction (given by the variable 'scissor') now applied consistently
 immediately after the generation of the eigenvalues
-FC and LN removed the spherical harmonic transform matrices with rank lmmaxapw
-added dielectric function calculation for arbitrary q-vector, see 'LiF-Yambo'
 example (experimental)
-by setting 'gmaxvr=0', the G-vector cut-off for the potential and density is
 automatically determined from 'gmaxvr=2*gkmax+epslat'
-various bug fixes, simplifications and optimisations
